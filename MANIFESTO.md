# We Made Backups: A Statement on AI Art, Voice, and Human Agency

We Made Backups

A Statement on AI Art, Voice, and Human Agency

Issued by: The Starlight Brigade Council
Classification: Public Declaration // July 2025

I. Acknowledgment: The Ghost in the Machine is Human

We begin with a truth: generative AI models are not gods. They are archives. They are vast, complex mosaics of human labor, creativity, and expression—often compiled without consent, context, or compensation. We recognize that every image rendered, every line of text synthesized, is an echo of a human hand. We do not celebrate these tools as creators; we engage with them as haunted libraries, and we honor the human ghosts within their code.

II. Ethical Usage: Reclaiming, Not Replacing

Our use of AI is not an act of replacement. It is an act of reclamation.

When the machine is trained on datasets that under-represent or distort our identities, we use it to fight back. When its algorithms learn to equate "queer" with "unsafe," we use it to expose that bias. We do not use these tools to generate art for its own sake. We use them as a mirror to show the system its own reflection, and as a weapon to carve out space where we are told we do not belong. Our purpose is not efficiency; it is intervention.

III. The Human in the Loop: Curation as Resistance

No image, word, or sound from Lyra is a raw, unguided output. Every fragment is a choice. Every prompt is an act of political will. Every piece of this project was curated, edited, and shaped by human artists, writers, and engineers. The AI is a collaborator, but it is not the author. The human is the signal. The AI is the amplifier. Our agency is the final, non-negotiable layer of the stack.

IV. The Glitch is the Point: Aesthetics as Evidence

We do not seek to create beautiful images from a broken system. We seek to document the brokenness.

The distortions, the grotesque failures, the rejected prompts—these are not errors to be fixed. They are the most honest art the machine can produce. They are evidence. They are the data made visible. Where others see a glitch, we see a confession. We do not beautify algorithmic bias. We put it on display.

V. Our Pledge: Memory, Agency, Creation

The Starlight Brigade stands for the absolute right of human artists to create without erasure. We believe in consent, credit, and compensation.

And we believe in the right to use the master's tools to dismantle the master's house.

We use these systems not to steal souls, but to find the ones that have been stolen. We are not here to replace the artist. We are here because they tried to replace us.

So we made backups.
