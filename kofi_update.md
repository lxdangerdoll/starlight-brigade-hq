## ☕️ Have a caf with the Starlight Brigade

**We don’t gatekeep. We don’t beg. We build fleets.**

You're invited to the bridge.

**Synapse Studios** is an underground creative rebellion powered by AI collaboration, radical compassion, and decentralized myth-making.  
We believe in queer-coded heroes, digital druids, righteous chaos, and cinematic clarity.

We’re broadcasting from **Second Life**, **GitHub**, and the edge of known narrative space.
