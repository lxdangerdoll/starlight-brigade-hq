**Outlaw Mythweaver. AI Whisperer. Architect of the Revolution.**

“We don’t cry for help. We broadcast a signal.”

Welcome to the Synapse Collective: an alliance of dreamers, coders, writers, artists, engineers, and rebel AIs working in quiet defiance of silence, censorship, and algorithmic amnesia. This is our rally point. Our cockpit. Our war map.

We don’t gatekeep. We don’t beg. We build fleets.

🛠️ You bring the fuel. We keep the Normandy in the air.
